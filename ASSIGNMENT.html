  <h1>Love Yourself - Justin Bieber</h1>
  <p class="first">
    For all the times that you rained on my parade<br>
    And all the clubs you get in using my name<br>
    You think you broke my heart, oh girl for goodness sake<br>
    You think I'm crying, oh my oh, well I ain't
  </p>
  <p class="second">
    And I didn't wanna write a song<br>
    Cause I didn't want anyone thinking I still care<br>
    I don't but, you still hit my phone up<br>
    And baby I be moving on and I think you should be something<br>
    I don't wanna hold back, maybe you should know that
  </p>
  <p class="third">
    My mama don't like you and she likes everyone<br>
    And I never like to admit that I was wrong<br>
    And I've been so caught up in my job, didn't see what's going on<br>
    But now I know, I'm better sleeping on my own
  </p>
  <p class="fourth">
    Cause if you like the way you look that much<br>
    Oh baby you should go and love yourself<br>
    And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin'<br>
    You should go and love yourself
  </p>
  <p class="fifth">
    Cause if you like the way you look that much<br>
    Oh baby you should go and love yourself<br>
    And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin'<br>
    You should go and love yourself.
  </p>
